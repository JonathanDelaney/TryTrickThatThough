## About

Having looked online for examples of flask games, none could be found so I decided to see if I could programme one myself, without the use of JS. This webapp is possibly the only example of a flask/jinja game and the only representation of 4d tic-tac-toe on one board. This 'look mom, no JS!' website is an example of what can be done to create front-end interactivity with just html, css and python with flask. The game uses innovative methods, to solve for win scenarios and create, dumb, computer opposition. In the future I plan to use this method to allow for online mutliplayer playing, implemented using a rest-api.

## User Stories

- The Avid Gamer

  - I expect to be able to have an engrossing experience gaming.
  - The website should allow me to play quickly and easily with little loading/buffering.
  - I expect there to be a competetive element and for there to be a learning curve and a difficulty that requires surpassing.

- The Casual Gamer

  - I expect to be able to play quickly and easily as a priority.
  - The game should have an intermediate difficulty and an easy option.
  - I expect to be engaged and kept interested while I waste some time playing the game.

- A Younger, Older or Noob Gamer

  - The website should be clear and easy to use and understand.
  - I expect there to be a community of players and administrators to provide feedback about the game.
  - There should be instructions on how to use the game and they should be thurough.
  - I expect to be given an easy playing option.

## Design and Creation

For this project I had initially intended on creating an online multiplayer game but, in the end, ran out of time to implement the rest api to support this feature and had to settle for a local game to be played against the computer or a friend on the one device.
<br>
<br>
Tic-tac-toe had occured to me as being the easiest to create and one which would be ideal as a proof of concept. The addition of higher dimensions came as I developed the vector method for solving the game. This method allowed me to up the dimensions easily without adding much complexity to the code. I was also forced to use this method as I didn't want to use JS and flask could only return coordinates.
<br>
<br>
I wanted to create a 3D board that could be generated by jinja based on parameters set by the user. The jinja for loops take the width and number of dimensions set by the user and generate the appropriate board. The css which gives perspective is determined by the iteration of the for loop; pieces that were layed out in early iterations will be smaller than those layed out in later iterations, giving the desired 3D effect.
<br>
<br>
The aesthetic I opted for is a space theme. I thought this fit the multidimensionality of the game and added to the games mystique in being a novel game which the user would never have seen before. The game can be branded as an 'outer space' version of tic-tac-toe.
<br>
<br>
Some difficulty lay in making the layout intuitive to understand in its representation of 4 dimensions. I opted for sections of squares with pointed squares on either end to signify the fourth dimension corners and edges. To explain, there are 2 4D corners per 3D corner and 2 4D edges per 3D edge and with the inner sections and face sections there are 2 4D end points within each section. This was the best way I could think of representing 4D tic-tac-toe in a 3D grid. I have to admit that it does require explanation but there are few 4D concepts which don't, if the fourth dimenion is physical. I believe this design achieves the best possible way of making higher dimensional tic-tac-toe intuitive.

### The Solution Function

The traditional method of checking for a win scenraio would be by checking each row, column and diagonal after each go and if all sections of one are full with either an X or an O, or red or blue, then there would be a victory for that user. This allows for an easy computation for a computer opponent also. The computer would fill a remaining space if the rest were filled with the users mark.
<br>
<br>
Using coordinates instead meant that vectors were needed to create lines which could be completed. When a coordinate is submitted by a user it is cross referenced against all previous coordinates inputted by the user and if it could exist on a line with that coordinate to form a run it is added to a list of potential runs. It is also cross referenced against all potential runs that have been collected by that function. If the number of coordinates in a potential run equals the width of the board then there is a victory.
<br>
<br>
The computer can block the user by completing a potential run of the opponent. If the computer sees that there exists a potential run that is equal to the width of the board minus one then it will submit the remaning coordinate that would complete that run. If a run of such length does not exist then the computer will play randomly. This behaviour of the computer makes it easy enough to beat but requires some setting up.

## Mockups

## Features

* ### Sign In and Register Pages

    - These pages are quite simple and I didn't want to distract from the overall intention behind these pages which is to get the user to register or sign in. The user gets a feel for the website's theme with the space background whcih is present throuhgout the website. I have added two boxes either side of the input fields which are a shape found on the game board. This is a motif which is a thread to tie together the beginning of the user experience to the end and also the beginning and end of a section in the game.


* ### Discussion Page

    - This page contains all the relevant information for a user to see how they fare compared with other users and to be able to discuss this and features and quirks of multidimensional ti-tac-toe.
    - The page starts with a top 10 leasderboard and a button to allow you to view the entire leaderboard. This is to get the user interested in playing the game more to improve their own score.
    - The Page provides the user with a commenting function. I wanted to create a community which could discuss the quirks of the game and have some banter about positions on the leaderboard.
    - The user can edit or delete any comment they have made and the comments are displayed in chronological order so that the most recent comments are displayed at the top. Any new user can get the latest in the discussion.


* ### Games Page

    - The game page provides the user with an initial welcome message and a provocative 'let's play'.
    - The user is given the settings options to setup the board properties and these are presented to the user in the form of select inputs so the user doesn't have to type.
    - When the user has chosen a set of parameters and an opponent they can press the 'play' button and begin playing.
